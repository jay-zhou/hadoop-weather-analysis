# hadoop-weather-analysis
The project is to download weather history data for most of the countries in the world and put data to HDFS. After data is put in HDFS, mapper and reducer jobs run against it and saved the analysis results to HBase. The code is developed and executed on Hadoop 2.8 using Java and Hbase as the NoSQL database.
